# Pizzeria
This is a Code with Angular Framework and XAMPP, The project is a web system to manage the inventory of a pizzeria's menu.

IMPORTANT!! You need to install SweetAlert2 for the code to display certain necessary functions.
npm install sweetalert2

The database is named "base_pizzeria," and the only table within the project is named "pedidos" (orders).
To copy the files, you need to create a project within the `htdocs` directory of XAMPP. Follow the steps to create a project with the name `base_pizzeria` (the database name and project name are the same to avoid confusion). Enter the project folder and paste the files. It may prompt you to replace some files with the same names; select 'Yes' to replace them.
